# **Audience**

The foundation of great marketing is an up-to-date audience of contacts, including important data like who has interacted with your online store and when they subscribed to your emails. Mailchimp offers powerful and flexible tools that help you manage this information and use it to create targeted campaigns.

We'll cover a few basics about your audience in this article, including what you need to know before you start importing contacts into Mailchimp.

Things to consider
How you build and manage your audience affects the ways you can use Mailchimp. With the right data and organization, you can segment contacts based on a variety of criteria and send certain content to target groups. Take a moment to think about your marketing goals, who your contacts are, and what information is relevant to them.

## **Types of contacts**
Your Mailchimp audience is designed to help you collect and manage subscribed, non-subscribed, and unsubscribed contacts.

Here are some definitions for each.

Subscribed contact
Someone who has opted in to receive your email marketing campaigns.
Unsubscribed contact
Someone who was opted in to receive your email marketing campaigns, but isn't currently.
Non-subscribed contact
Someone who has interacted with your online store, but hasn't opted in to receive your email marketing campaigns.

## **Create an audience**
When you create a Mailchimp account, we'll ask you for some information to comply with anti-spam practices and help you track performance. We’ll use this information to get your audience started. All you have to do next is add or collect some contacts.

You can add subscribed contacts one-by-one or multiple, upload contacts from a file, copy and paste contacts from a spreadsheet, or use an integration to sync your contacts. We prohibit users from sending to purchased, rented, or third-party lists, so be sure to check our audience requirements before you begin.

### **How to add a subscribed contact**
**To add a single subscribed contact to an audience, follow these steps.**


1. Click Audience

2. Click the Audience dashboard.

   ![This is an image](https://i.imgur.com/HoDYTOO.png)

5. Type in the subscriber's information and check the **This person gave me permission to email them** box.

    ![This is an image](https://i.imgur.com/wg3itWa.png)

6. Apply any necessary tags. If you have groups set up in your audience, those options will appear here.
7. When you're done, click **Subscribe.**

    ![This is an image](https://i.imgur.com/pG8omjj.png)

If the email address is already on your audience and you want to update the information you have on file, check the If this person is already in my audience, update their profile box.

After the person has been successfully added, we'll display a success message at the top of the page.

### **How to import multiple subscriber**

The file import process has two parts: First, you'll prepare your spreadsheet of contacts outside of Mailchimp and save it as a CSV file. Next, you'll use our import tool to upload your file and add your contacts to your Mailchimp audience.

**To prepare your file for import, follow these steps.**

1. In a spreadsheet program like Excel or Google Sheets, open your blank worksheet.
2. Create and label a column for **Email Address**. This is the only field we require.

    ![This is an image](https://i.imgur.com/r65Y8SX.png)

3. Next to your Email Address column, create and label additional columns for First Name, Last Name, and any other information you want to import to Mailchimp.

    ![This is an image](https://i.imgur.com/YgQCKPS.png)

To learn how to format phone numbers, birthdays, mailing addresses, and other types of data, check out [Format Guidelines for your Import File.](https://mailchimp.com/help/format-guidelines-for-your-import-file/)

4. Paste your contacts' information into the relevant fields in the spreadsheet.
   
   ![This is an image](https://i.imgur.com/ibCL6G7.png)

5. Save the file in CSV format. This option can usually be accessed from the **File** menu in your spreadsheet program, labeled as "Export as .CSV" or "Download as .CSV". Different spreadsheet programs will vary a little bit.

11. If your audience has [groups](https://mailchimp.com/help/getting-started-with-groups/), you can import your contacts directly into the group of your choice. Navigate to the **Select groups** section and check the box next to each group that applies.
    
    ![This is an image](https://i.imgur.com/1rJWAGK.png)

    ![This is an image](https://i.imgur.com/wvvT3Aj.png)

    ![This is an image](https://i.imgur.com/dYRNg1C.png)

That's it! After the import is finished, we'll send a notification to the email address associated with your username.

---
Note
    
- Imported subscribers don't go through [the signup process](https://mailchimp.com/help/about-signup-form-options/), so you'll need to verify that you have permission to email them.
- When you import contacts to an existing audience, we won’t include any duplicate, bounced, or unsubscribed addresses that are already stored in the audience.
- Because all audiences in Mailchimp are independent of each other, we can't detect duplicates, bounces, or unsubscribes across multiple audiences. If you have duplicate contacts in different audiences, you may find it helpful to combine your audiences into a primary audience that uses groups or tags.

## **Signup forms**
**Signup** forms are an easy but powerful way to extend the reach of your email marketing and enhance your long-term audience growth. Mailchimp offers a number of options to attract subscribers on your website, social channels, and other platforms.

In this article, you'll learn about Mailchimp's signup form options, so you can choose which type of form is best for you.

Mailchimp audiences are single opt-in by default. That means, each time someone fills out and submits your signup form, we'll immediately add them to your Mailchimp audience as a subscribed contact. This makes it easier for people to join your audience, which can be helpful if you're selling a product or capturing customers on the go.


  - ### **Landing page signup form**

    Design a shareable landing page to collect new contacts as part of a specific marketing goal. For example, boost your audience growth by collecting addresses in exchange for a free download or other limited-time offer.

    ![This is an image](https://i.imgur.com/wb2lXyO.png)

    Use the Signup Form content block to create a simple form with the email address field from your audience. You can then choose to include more fields from your main hosted form as needed.

    [**Create a Landing Page**](https://mailchimp.com/help/create-a-landing-page/)

  - ### **Embedded form**
    
    With our embedded forms, you choose the type of form you want to display on your site, and we give you the code to use. Choose from our Classic, Horizontal, Condensed, and Unstyled forms. If you're comfortable with HTML, edit the form code to fit your organization's style and brand.

    [**Add a Signup Form to Your Website**](https://mailchimp.com/help/add-a-signup-form-to-your-website/)

 - ### **Pop-up form**
   This form appears inside a pop-up on your website, based on criteria you set. Create and design the form in Mailchimp, then add it to your website in Mailchimp or another platform.

# **Campaigns**
When designing email campaigns, focus on your message and keep your design straightforward. We suggest laying out all the elements for your campaign in a hierarchy, putting your most important information or the main takeaway toward the top so people can quickly scan your email if they’re short on time.

## **Create an email**

To create a regular mail, follow these steps.

1. Click the **Create** icon.
   
   ![This is an image](https://i.imgur.com/P9lEMAa.png)

2. Click the **Email** drop-down.
   
   ![This is an image](https://i.imgur.com/WFE6gar.png)

   ![This is an image](https://i.imgur.com/eS5HPFQ.png)

This will take you to builder, where you'll choose your settings and design your content.

## **Setup and design**

Our email builder is designed to let you work on the different parts of your email in the order you choose, and review everything at once before you send.

There are four main things to do before you can send.
 - Add your recipients in the **To** section.
 - Add your from name and from email address in the **From** section.
 - Add your subject line in the **Subject** section.
 - Design your email in the **Content** section.

As each task is completed, a green checkmark will appear next to the corresponding section.

![This is an image](https://i.imgur.com/YDItwUu.png)

You may also want to review your tracking options and other settings.

### **Add recipients**

To choose your recipients, follow these steps.

   1. In the **To** section, click **Add Recipients**.
   
      ![This is an image](https://i.imgur.com/bKZDO7t.png)

   2. In the **Audience** drop-down menu, choose the audience you want to send to.
 
   3. In the **Segment or Tag** drop-down menu, choose **All subscribers in audience, Group or new segment,** or one of the available saved or pre-built options.
       
      ![This is an image](https://i.imgur.com/GcQx4NB.png)
    
   4. **Optional:** Check the **Personalize the "To" field** box to display the recipient's name instead of their email address. This is more personal and may help you avoid spam filters.

      ![This is an image](https://i.imgur.com/RNiY4Kr.png)

      After you check the box, you'll choose a merge tag that corresponds with the data you want to display in the "To" field. For example, if you choose **|FNAME|**, a recipient named Bob will see "To: Bob" instead of "To: phrdc@example.com." The default options are **|FNAME|**, **|LNAME|**, and **|FNAME|** **|LNAME|**, but you can click **Custom** to enter an alternate tag or text.

   5. Click **Save**.

### **Send to a custom segment or group**

   4. Click **Save**.

### **Exclude contacts from a campaign**

You can exclude contacts from receiving a campaign by using the segment builder. To exclude a specific segment, use the opposite of the modifier that would be used to include that segment.

For example, a segment that only includes those who joined your audience via your **Hosted Signup Form** would be built as **Signup Source | was | Hosted Signup Form.**

If you want to exclude all contacts who joined via your **Hosted Signup Form**, then your segment would be built as Signup Source | was not | Hosted Signup Form.
