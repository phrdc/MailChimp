# **Audience**

## **Audience Dashboard**

The foundation of great marketing is an up-to-date audience of contacts, including important data like who has interacted with your online store and when they subscribed to your emails. Mailchimp offers powerful and flexible tools that help you manage this information and use it to create targeted campaigns.

We'll cover a few basics about your audience in this article, including what you need to know before you start importing contacts into Mailchimp.

Things to consider
How you build and manage your audience affects the ways you can use Mailchimp. With the right data and organization, you can segment contacts based on a variety of criteria and send certain content to target groups. Take a moment to think about your marketing goals, who your contacts are, and what information is relevant to them.

## **Types of contacts**
Your Mailchimp audience is designed to help you collect and manage subscribed, non-subscribed, and unsubscribed contacts.

Here are some definitions for each.

Subscribed contact
Someone who has opted in to receive your email marketing campaigns.
Unsubscribed contact
Someone who was opted in to receive your email marketing campaigns, but isn't currently.
Non-subscribed contact
Someone who has interacted with your online store, but hasn't opted in to receive your email marketing campaigns.

## **Create an audience**
When you create a Mailchimp account, we'll ask you for some information to comply with anti-spam practices and help you track performance. We’ll use this information to get your audience started. All you have to do next is add or collect some contacts.

You can add subscribed contacts one-by-one or multiple, upload contacts from a file, copy and paste contacts from a spreadsheet, or use an integration to sync your contacts. We prohibit users from sending to purchased, rented, or third-party lists, so be sure to check our audience requirements before you begin.

### **How to add a subscribed contact**
**To add a single subscribed contact to an audience, follow these steps.**


1. Click Audience

    ![This is an image](https://i.imgur.com/5W6kgTO.png)

2. Click the Audience dashboard.

    ![This is an image](https://i.imgur.com/7jG7rNx.png)

3. If you have more than one audience, click the **Current audience** drop-down and choose the one you want to work with.
4. Click the **Manage Audience** drop-down and choose **Add a subscriber.**
5. Type in the subscriber's information and check the **This person gave me permission to email them** box.

    ![This is an image](https://i.imgur.com/wg3itWa.png)

6. Apply any necessary tags. If you have groups set up in your audience, those options will appear here.
7. When you're done, click **Subscribe.**

    ![This is an image](https://i.imgur.com/pG8omjj.png)

If the email address is already on your audience and you want to update the information you have on file, check the If this person is already in my audience, update their profile box.

After the person has been successfully added, we'll display a success message at the top of the page.

### **How to import multiple subscriber**

The file import process has two parts: First, you'll prepare your spreadsheet of contacts outside of Mailchimp and save it as a CSV file. Next, you'll use our import tool to upload your file and add your contacts to your Mailchimp audience.

**To prepare your file for import, follow these steps.**

1. In a spreadsheet program like Excel or Google Sheets, open your blank worksheet.
2. Create and label a column for **Email Address**. This is the only field we require.

    ![This is an image](https://i.imgur.com/r65Y8SX.png)

3. Next to your Email Address column, create and label additional columns for First Name, Last Name, and any other information you want to import to Mailchimp.

    ![This is an image](https://i.imgur.com/YgQCKPS.png)

To learn how to format phone numbers, birthdays, mailing addresses, and other types of data, check out [Format Guidelines for your Import File.](https://mailchimp.com/help/format-guidelines-for-your-import-file/)

4. Paste your contacts' information into the relevant fields in the spreadsheet.
   
   ![This is an image](https://i.imgur.com/ibCL6G7.png)

5. Save the file in CSV format. This option can usually be accessed from the **File** menu in your spreadsheet program, labeled as "Export as .CSV" or "Download as .CSV". Different spreadsheet programs will vary a little bit.

    - Subscribed
    - Unsubscribed

11. If your audience has [groups](https://mailchimp.com/help/getting-started-with-groups/), you can import your contacts directly into the group of your choice. Navigate to the **Select groups** section and check the box next to each group that applies.
    
    ![This is an image](https://i.imgur.com/1rJWAGK.png)

    ![This is an image](https://i.imgur.com/dYRNg1C.png)

That's it! After the import is finished, we'll send a notification to the email address associated with your username.

Note
    
- Imported subscribers don't go through [the signup process](https://mailchimp.com/help/about-signup-form-options/), so you'll need to verify that you have permission to email them.
- When you import contacts to an existing audience, we won’t include any duplicate, bounced, or unsubscribed addresses that are already stored in the audience.
- Because all audiences in Mailchimp are independent of each other, we can't detect duplicates, bounces, or unsubscribes across multiple audiences. If you have duplicate contacts in different audiences, you may find it helpful to combine your audiences into a primary audience that uses groups or tags.

# **Campaigns**
When designing email campaigns, focus on your message and keep your design straightforward. We suggest laying out all the elements for your campaign in a hierarchy, putting your most important information or the main takeaway toward the top so people can quickly scan your email if they’re short on time.

## **Create an email**

To create a regular mail, follow these steps.

1. Click the **Create** icon.
   
   ![This is an image](https://i.imgur.com/P9lEMAa.png)

2. Click the **Email** drop-down.
   
   ![This is an image](https://i.imgur.com/WFE6gar.png)

   ![This is an image](https://i.imgur.com/eS5HPFQ.png)

This will take you to builder, where you'll choose your settings and design your content.

## **Setup and design**

Our email builder is designed to let you work on the different parts of your email in the order you choose, and review everything at once before you send.

There are four main things to do before you can send.
 - Add your recipients in the **To** section.
 - Add your from name and from email address in the **From** section.
 - Add your subject line in the **Subject** section.
 - Design your email in the **Content** section.

As each task is completed, a green checkmark will appear next to the corresponding section.

![This is an image](https://i.imgur.com/YDItwUu.png)

You may also want to review your tracking options and other settings.

### **Add recipients**

To choose your recipients, follow these steps.

   1. In the **To** section, click **Add Recipients**.
   
      ![This is an image](https://i.imgur.com/bKZDO7t.png)

   2. In the **Audience** drop-down menu, choose the audience you want to send to.
 
   3. In the **Segment or Tag** drop-down menu, choose **All subscribers in audience, Group or new segment,** or one of the available saved or pre-built options.
       
      ![This is an image](https://i.imgur.com/GcQx4NB.png)
    
   4. **Optional:** Check the **Personalize the "To" field** box to display the recipient's name instead of their email address. This is more personal and may help you avoid spam filters.

      ![This is an image](https://i.imgur.com/RNiY4Kr.png)

      After you check the box, you'll choose a merge tag that corresponds with the data you want to display in the "To" field. For example, if you choose **|FNAME|**, a recipient named Bob will see "To: Bob" instead of "To: phrdc@example.com." The default options are **|FNAME|**, **|LNAME|**, and **|FNAME|** **|LNAME|**, but you can click **Custom** to enter an alternate tag or text.

   5. Click **Save**.

### **Send to a custom segment or group**

To send a campaign to a one-off custom segment or a group within your audience, follow these steps.

   1. Select the audience you would like to send in the **Audience** drop-down menu.
   2. Click **Group or new segment** in the **Segment or Tag** drop-down menu.
   
      ![This is an image](https://i.imgur.com/x6BMU6b.png)
    
   3. Create the segment that you would like to send to. To learn more about creating segments, check out [**Create and Send to a Segment**](https://mailchimp.com/help/create-and-send-to-a-segment/).

      ![This is an image](https://i.imgur.com/oFkuL9a.png)
    
   4. Click **Save**.

### **Exclude contacts from a campaign**

You can exclude contacts from receiving a campaign by using the segment builder. To exclude a specific segment, use the opposite of the modifier that would be used to include that segment.

For example, a segment that only includes those who joined your audience via your **Hosted Signup Form** would be built as **Signup Source | was | Hosted Signup Form.**

If you want to exclude all contacts who joined via your **Hosted Signup Form**, then your segment would be built as Signup Source | was not | Hosted Signup Form.
